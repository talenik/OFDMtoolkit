<H1>Toolkit for simulations of OFDM transmission in MATLAB</H1>
<H2>(and perhaps GNU Octave)</H2>
<H2> Contains: </H2>
- Signal space modulators: BPSK, QPSK/4QAM with and withouth differential encoding
- differential encoder/decoder for higher order modulations
- OFDM trasmitter & receiver with Cyclic prefix
- Rayleigh and AWGN channel models
- Uncoded or LDPC-encoded transmission
- with or withouth jamming

<H2>How to install</H2>

1. Just download and open in MATLAB.
2. Need to have your mex configured and gcc (build-essential) installed

<H2>To run from MATLAB</H2>
